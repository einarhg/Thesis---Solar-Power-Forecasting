	abstract = {Global radiation measured on fixed-tilt, sun-facing planes (40° and vertical) and a 2-axis tracker at NREL’s Solar Radiation Research Lab. in Golden, CO is compared to predictions from ten transposition models, in combination with either optimal or suboptimal input data of horizontal irradiance. Suboptimal inputs are typically used in everyday engineering calculations, for which the necessary data are usually unavailable for the site under scrutiny, and must be estimated in some way. The performance of the transposition models is first evaluated for ideal conditions when optimal data are used. The performance of three direct/diffuse separation models is also evaluated. Finally, the performance of the resulting combinations is analyzed in a variety of situations. It is concluded that, for sunny sites such as this one, the Gueymard and Perez models provide the best estimates of global tilted irradiance only when optimal input data are used. When only global irradiance is known, the accuracy of the predicted tilted irradiance degrades significantly, and is conditioned by the local performance of the direct/diffuse separation method and, for vertical tilts in particular, by the accuracy in the ground reflection calculations.},

	abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model () is a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. NWP refers to the simulation and prediction of the atmosphere with a computer model, and WRF is a set of software for this. WRF features two dynamical (computational) cores (or solvers), a data assimilation system, and a software architecture allowing for parallel computation and system extensibility. The model serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers.
The effort to develop WRF began in the latter part of the 1990s and was a collaborative partnership principally among the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (represented by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the (then) Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL)), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the University of Oklahoma (OU), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The bulk of the work on the model has been performed or supported by NCAR, NOAA, and AFWA.
WRF allows researchers to produce simulations reflecting either real data (observations, analyses) or idealized atmospheric conditions. WRF provides operational forecasting a flexible and robust platform, while offering advances in physics, numerics, and data assimilation contributed by the many research community developers. WRF is currently in operational use at NCEP and other forecasting centers internationally. WRF has grown to have a large worldwide community of users (over 30,000 registered users in over 150 countries), and workshops and tutorials are held each year at NCAR. WRF is used extensively for research and real-time forecasting throughout the world. It has been shown to perform well in simulating Atmospheric convection, but to be prone to producing squall lines too easily.WRF offers two dynamical solvers for its computation of the atmospheric governing equations, and the variants of the model are known as WRF-ARW (Advanced Research WRF) and WRF-NMM (nonhydrostatic mesoscale model). The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) is supported to the community by the NCAR Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory. The WRF-NMM solver variant was based on the Eta model, and later nonhydrostatic mesoscale model, developed at NCEP. The WRF-NMM (NMM) is supported to the community by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).
The WRF serves as the basis for the RAP and HRRR models: high-resolution operational forecast models run regularly at NCEP. The WRF also serves as the basis for the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model at 12km and 3km grid resolutions. A version of WRF-NMM tailored for hurricane forecasting, HWRF (hurricane weather research and forecasting), became operational in 2007.In 2009, a polar optimized WRF was released through the Byrd Polar Research Center at the Ohio State University.},

	abstract = {Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses  mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results.  A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs.
Mathematical models based on the same physical principles can be used to generate either short-term weather forecasts or longer-term climate predictions; the latter are widely applied for understanding  and projecting climate change. The improvements made to regional models have allowed for significant improvements in tropical cyclone track and air quality forecasts; however, atmospheric models perform poorly at handling processes that occur in a relatively constricted area, such as wildfires.
Manipulating the vast datasets and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.  Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to only about six days. Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves.  Post-processing techniques such as model output statistics (MOS) have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions.
A more fundamental problem lies in the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with accurate input data and a flawless model.  In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, and the effects of terrain.  In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.},

	abstract = {In machine learning, backpropagation (backprop, BP) is a widely used algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. Generalizations of backpropagation exist for other artificial neural networks (ANNs), and for functions generally. These classes of algorithms are all referred to generically as "backpropagation". In fitting a neural network, backpropagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually. This efficiency makes it feasible to use gradient methods for training multilayer networks, updating weights to minimize loss; gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent, are commonly used. The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this is an example of dynamic programming.The term backpropagation strictly refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; however, the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm, including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent. Backpropagation generalizes the gradient computation in the delta rule, which is the single-layer version of backpropagation, and is in turn generalized by automatic differentiation, where backpropagation is a special case of reverse accumulation (or "reverse mode"). The term backpropagation and its general use in neural networks was announced in Rumelhart, Hinton \& Williams (1986a), then elaborated and popularized in Rumelhart, Hinton \& Williams (1986b), but the technique was independently rediscovered many times, and had many predecessors dating to the 1960s; see § History. A modern overview is given in the deep learning textbook by Goodfellow, Bengio \& Courville (2016).},

	abstract = {A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.The term “recurrent neural network” is used indiscriminately to refer to two broad classes of networks with a similar general structure, where one is finite impulse and the other is infinite impulse. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled.
Both finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can have additional stored states, and the storage can be under direct control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph, if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units. This is also called Feedback Neural Network (FNN).},

            WRF-Solar is a specific configuration and augmentation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model designed for solar energy applications. Recent upgrades to the WRF Model contribute to making the model appropriate for solar power forecasting and comprise 1) developments to diagnose internally relevant atmospheric parameters required by the solar industry, 2) improved representation of aerosol–radiation feedback, 3) incorporation of cloud–aerosol interactions, and 4) improved cloud–radiation feedback. The WRF-Solar developments are presented together with a comprehensive characterization of the model performance for forecasting during clear skies. Performance is evaluated with numerical experiments using a range of different external and internal treatment of the atmospheric aerosols, including both a model-derived climatology of aerosol optical depth and temporally evolving aerosol optical properties from reanalysis products. The necessity of incorporating the influence of atmospheric aerosols to obtain accurate estimations of the surface shortwave irradiance components in clear-sky conditions is evident. Improvements of up to 58\%, 76\%, and 83\% are found in global horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance, and diffuse irradiance, respectively, compared to a standard version of the WRF Model. Results demonstrate that the WRF-Solar model is an improved numerical tool for research and applications in support of solar energy.},

	abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models which do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attentionbased architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at diﬀerent scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.},

Obviously, RE generation is dependent on the weather conditions and because of this, solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation models are inherently nonlinear. This paper explores applicability of artificial neural networks (NN) to model solar power generation as a part of standalone microgrids found on remote islands. Specifically, it applies NN tools to the generation, weather, and irradiance time series data for the Isle of Eigg, Scotland, and shows a potential for further investigation including the predictive modeling based just on weather data that can then be used for optimization of the microgrid and microgrid performance.},

In this paper, a comprehensive comparative analysis is performed, evaluating ten recent neural networks and intelligent algorithms of the literature in short-term PV forecasting. All methods are properly fine-tuned and assessed on a one-year dataset of a 406 MWp PV plant in the UK. Furthermore, a new hybrid prediction strategy is proposed and evaluated, derived as an aggregation of the most well-performing forecasting models. Simulation results in MATLAB show that the season of the year affects the accuracy of all methods, the proposed hybrid one performing most favorably overall.},

Consequently, operations and maintenance cost now have a large impact on the proﬁt of managing power modules, and the energy market participants need to estimate the solar power in short or long terms of future. In this paper, we propose a solar power forecasting technique by utilizing convolutional neural networks and long–shortterm memory networks recently developed for analyzing time series data in the deep learning communities. Considering that weather information may not be always available for the location where PV modules are installed and sensors are often damaged, we empirically conﬁrm that the proposed method predicts the solar power well with roughly estimated weather data obtained from national weather centers as well as it works robustly without sophisticatedly preprocessed input to remove outliers.},

	abstract = {Solar energy penetration both at utility scale and residential scale has been increasing at an exponential rate. However, its stochastic nature poses great challenge to power grid operation. Knowing how much solar energy generation in advance is vital for power grid balancing, planning and optimization. Therefore, solar energy generation forecast is essential for the stability and operation efﬁciency of today’s smart grid. Although the sun path and energy can be computed with physical laws, the prediction of solar energy generation and production remains very challenging problem both in the ﬁeld of physical simulation and artiﬁcial intelligence. The main reason lies in the fact that the actual solar production are impacted by many factors including the sun position, weather condition and the characteristics of photovoltaic panel, curtailment, etc. Especially in cloudy day, where the cloud movement becomes the main factor in solar energy production. However, predicting the movement of cloud is extremely difﬁcult. In this paper, we present several deep convolutional neural networks utilizing high resolution weather forecast data exploring various temporal and spatial connectivities to capture the cloud movement pattern and its effect on forecasting solar energy generation for solar farms. Comparing with state-of-the-art forecast error rate, we have been able to reduce the error rate from about 21\% in the persistent model, to 15.1\% from the SVR model, and to 11.8\% from the convolutional neural networks. These improvements have signiﬁcant impact on the healthy growth of the solar energy industry, will save billions of dollars for the US utilities and most importantly reduce dependency on fossil fuel and reduction in CO2 emission.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

In this paper, case based reasoning (CBR) is proposed for weather forecast text generation because similar weather conditions occur over time and should have similar forecast texts. CBR-METEO, a system for generating weather forecast texts was developed using a generic framework (jCOLIBRI) which provides modules for the standard components of the CBR architecture. The advantage in a CBR approach is that systems can be built in minimal time with far less human effort after initial consultation with experts. The approach depends heavily on the goodness of the retrieval and revision components of the CBR process. We evaluated CBRMETEO with NIST, an automated metric which has been shown to correlate well with human judgements for this domain. The system shows comparable performance with other NLG systems that perform the same task.},

A corpus-based analysis of how humans write forecasts showed that there were major differences in how individual writers performed this task, that is, in how they translated data into words. These differences included both different preferences between potential near-synonyms that could be used to express information, and also differences in the meanings that individual writers associated with speciﬁc words. Because we thought these differences could confuse readers, we built our SUMTIME-MOUSAM weather-forecast generator to use consistent data-to-word rules, which avoided words which were only used by a few people, and words which were interpreted differently by different people. An evaluation by forecast users suggested that they preferred SUMTIME-MOUSAM’s texts to human-generated texts, in part because of better word choice; this may be the ﬁrst time that an evaluation has shown that NLG texts are better than human-authored texts.},

Therefore, better approaches and instruments are required to bring the respect of the information. Apache spark is actually appropriate for performing machine learning on large-scale information. To discover out how rapidly Spark processes of huge information, we make an approach that utilize Machine Learning library (MLlib) classification algorithms in Apache Spark. We implement Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compare among them. The models are for analysis and predicting the sentiment based on a corona tweets. A sentiment analysis based on tweets is a challenging issue. The classification algorithm is assessed by precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy and time consumed. The results show that logistic regression algorithm has higher speed in doing enormous information processing than other chosen algorithms. Moreover, according to the obtained results, apache spark has exceptionally great speed in handling big data.

	abstract = {The need for scalable and efficient stream analysis has led to the development of many open-source streaming data processing systems (SDPSs) with highly diverging capabilities and performance characteristics. While first initiatives try to compare the systems for simple workloads, there is a clear gap of detailed analyses of the systems' performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework for benchmarking distributed stream processing engines. We use our suite to evaluate the performance of three widely used SDPSs in detail, namely Apache Storm, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. Our evaluation focuses in particular on measuring the throughput and latency of windowed operations, which are the basic type of operations in stream analytics. For this benchmark, we design workloads based on real-life, industrial use-cases inspired by the online gaming industry. The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we give a definition of latency and throughput for stateful operators. Second, we carefully separate the system under test and driver, in order to correctly represent the open world model of typical stream processing deployments and can, therefore, measure system performance under realistic conditions. Third, we build the first benchmarking framework to define and test the sustainable performance of streaming systems. Our detailed evaluation highlights the individual characteristics and use-cases of each system.},

With voluntary information sharing structure of Twitter, user disposition and sentiment analyses can be performed for determining the emotional well-being of the citizens.

For this purpose, over 35 million tweets, published in 2013 and in the first quarter of 2014, of over 20 thousand users were collected and analyzed. In the proposed model, prior to calculating the GNH by considering the polarities of tweets, first convergent and face validities of sentiment analysis and reliability of dataset were tested. After obtaining satisfactory results, the GNH by province survey results of Turkish Statistical Institute was compared to results of sentiment analysis for 2013 in order to state the difference between the surveying method and the proposed social media analysis method. Also, GNH by province in the first quarter of 2014 was analyzed. Additionally, relationships between users' account properties and happiness levels were investigated. Results showed that two GNH calculation approaches give similar results for the country-wide GNH levels. As a conclusion, GNH levels in the first quarter of 2014 were calculated as 47.4\% happy, 28.4\% neutral and 24.2\% unhappy. Besides, strong correlations were found between users' happiness levels and Twitter characteristics.},

Social media platforms such as Twitter offer tremendous opportunities for people to become engaged in such real-world events through information sharing and communicating about these events. However, little is understood about the factors that affect people’s Twitter engagement in such real-world events. In this paper, we address this question by ﬁrst operationalizing a person’s Twitter engagement in real-world events such as posting, retweeting, or replying to tweets about such events. Next, we construct statistical models that examine multiple predictive factors associated with four different perspectives of users’ Twitter engagement, and quantify their potential inﬂuence on predicting the (i) presence; and (ii) degree – of the user’s engagement with 643 real-world events. We also consider the effect of these factors with respect to a ﬁner granularization of the different categories of events. We ﬁnd that the measures of people’s prior Twitter activities, topical interests, geolocation, and social network structures are all variously correlated to their engagement with real-world events.},

	title = {Earthquake shakes {Twitter} users: real-time event detection by social sensors},
	abstract = {Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classiﬁer of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can ﬁnd the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman ﬁltering and particle ﬁltering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle ﬁlter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96\% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notiﬁcation is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.},

	abstract = {Solar energy penetration both at utility scale and residential scale has been increasing at an exponential rate. However, its stochastic nature poses great challenge to power grid operation. Knowing how much solar energy generation in advance is vital for power grid balancing, planning and optimization. Therefore, solar energy generation forecast is essential for the stability and operation efﬁciency of today’s smart grid. Although the sun path and energy can be computed with physical laws, the prediction of solar energy generation and production remains very challenging problem both in the ﬁeld of physical simulation and artiﬁcial intelligence. The main reason lies in the fact that the actual solar production are impacted by many factors including the sun position, weather condition and the characteristics of photovoltaic panel, curtailment, etc. Especially in cloudy day, where the cloud movement becomes the main factor in solar energy production. However, predicting the movement of cloud is extremely difﬁcult. In this paper, we present several deep convolutional neural networks utilizing high resolution weather forecast data exploring various temporal and spatial connectivities to capture the cloud movement pattern and its effect on forecasting solar energy generation for solar farms. Comparing with state-of-the-art forecast error rate, we have been able to reduce the error rate from about 21\% in the persistent model, to 15.1\% from the SVR model, and to 11.8\% from the convolutional neural networks. These improvements have signiﬁcant impact on the healthy growth of the solar energy industry, will save billions of dollars for the US utilities and most importantly reduce dependency on fossil fuel and reduction in CO2 emission.},

Such volatile infrastructure adds strain to the existing infrastructure and may lead to high transmission load on lines and corrupt power grid states. One way to resolve these issues is to establish regional energy markets. Such energy markets try to coordinate energy consumption or production regionally, based on estimates of future power grid states, thus reducing stress on the power grid. For these markets, it is crucial to know possible threatening grid states in advance to allow the market operators to keep the power grid in a healthy grid state with the help of regionally consumed or produced energy. In this work, we propose three different approaches to forecast future grid states with deep neural networks based on a learned numerical weather prediction representation. We evaluate these approaches with experimental results and discuss the remaining challenges that have to be addressed to enable regional energy markets.

	abstract = {Penetration of solar energy into main grid has gradually increased in recent years due to a growing number of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) farms. The power output of these PV farms may ﬂuctuate due to a wide variability of meteorological conditions, and, thus, we need to compensate for this effect in advance. In this paper, we propose a solar power prediction model based on various satellite images and a support vector machine (SVM) learning scheme. The motion vectors of clouds are forecasted by utilizing satellite images of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs). We analyze 4 years’ historical satellite images and utilize them to conﬁgure a large number of input and output data sets for the SVM learning. We compare the performance of the proposed SVM-based model, the conventional time-series model, and an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model in terms of prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Reliability and stability of a power system get decrease with the integration of large proportion of renewable energy. Renewable sources such as solar and wind are highly intermittent, and it is difficult to maintain system stability with intolerable proportion of renewable energy injection. Solar power forecasting can be used to improve system stability by providing approximated future power generation to system control engineers and it will facilitate dispatch of hydro power plants in an optimum way. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have shown great performance in time series forecasting and hence can be used to forecast power using weather parameters as model inputs. This paper presents the application of several ML algorithms for solar power forecasting in Buruthakanda solar park situated in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. The forecasting performance of implemented ML algorithms is compared with Smart Persistence (SP) method and the research shows that the ML models outperforms SP model.},

	abstract = {This research studies the factors influencing the efficiency of solar power plants to form a control system for increasing their performance. The case study is conducted in Lampang province, Thailand. The investigated factors include irradiance, humidity, wind speed, ambient temperature, module temperature and power peak. All the data are analysed correlating with the electric power. The results show that the major factor influencing the solar power plants is irradiance. The efficiency also depends on cleaning or dirty of panel. Therefore, solar power plants efficiency could be improved by periodically cleaning. The decision point of cleaning is analysed. It is used to create the program model. The module temperature influences on the energy generation. If the module temperature increases, the generated energy decreases. On the other hand, humidity, wind speed, ambient temperature and power peak had less significant effect on solar energy generation. After panel cleaning, generated energy is increased about 5.6\%-12.7\% a month or approximately 6,780 – 15,240 kW-hour per month. Finally, the income per unit is 0.19 USD and the value return is 4.5 times of investment cost.},
